	<h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
	<p>
		This definition explains the meaning of CSS (cascading style sheets) and how using them with HTML pages is a user interface (UI) development best practice that complies with the separation of concerns design pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		CSS is the standard and preferred mechanism for formatting HTML pages.
		Conforming with the separation of concerns design pattern and best practice, cascading style sheets provide a central location in which information about what various fonts, foreground colors, background colors, italicization and emphasization should be applied to various HTML elements within a webpage. Cascading style sheets can also control how various parts of a page, such as the header, footer, body, article content, sections and asides, are laid out on the page. This is extremely helpful when content must be laid out in a dramatically different fashion depending upon whether it is being viewed on a desktop, tablet or a smartphone.
